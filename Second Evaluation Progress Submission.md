### 	4. Name of Project - Covid Support Center

### 		5. Brief Description of Project

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The COVID-19 second wave is going much worse than the first one. From a shortage of beds to Remdesivir doses, the sudden surge in Covid cases across the country has left government and private hospitals scrambling. With soaring cases and overflowing hospitals, there is a growing demand for hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, plasma donors, and Remdesivir injections.

Amid the crisis, people on social media have come together, trying to help Covid patients and those in need about availability of resources. So instead of a vague platform like Twitter, Instagram, and Telegram, we have created a dedicated website towards the Covid-19 pandemic support. People can post questions and answers here.

### 		8. Technical Difficulties You are/were Facing

1. **Environment setup** - It took quite a decent of time to get used to setting up a MERN environment since we were new to the stack.
2. **Testing framework** - We do not have much knowledge about testing framework in MERN like we had of PyTest in Django. 
3. **Writing to MongoDB** - Error in sending data to server.
4. **Authentication Problem** - JWT token management. 

5. **Access To Local Storage** - Untrusted Script can access local storage. 

### 9. Logistical Issues You are Facing

1. Sorting by tags -  We did not take into account the sorting functionalities for the questions posted on the website.
